While street photographers with black-and-white film darted around pedestrians and traffic, he was attracted to storefronts with their harmonized symmetry and varying shades of gold between jelly jars and cider jugs. Traditionally, black and white was the choice of street photography, and color was for commercial work. His contemporaries, Joel Meyerowitz and Garry Winogrand, urged him to use color.",Tod Papageorge was relatively new to Manhattan and photography when he set out in,cf5b9f79-57cf-5e68-8a6b-90b87024ed84_cap0_1,street photographers with black-and-white film,cf5b9f79-57cf-5e68-8a6b-90b87024ed84_cap2_2,"His contemporaries, Joel Meyerowitz and Garry Winogrand,",cf5b9f79-57cf-5e68-8a6b-90b87024ed84_cap1_1

You can almost feel enveloped by cool water, and the movement in its expanse within the growing silence. Underwater, every sense is altered  visuals become magnified or dulled, acoustics shift with pressure and a sense of touch is amplified by both the odd weightlessness and the resistance of surrounding water, not to mention the temperature. It is an atmospheric, at times almost alien, world.","Underwater, every sense is altered  visuals become magnified or dulled, acoustics shift with pressure and a sense of touch",e116e24a-bd76-593f-9819-bbdb429bbafe_cap1_1,Michaela Skovranovas work has a dreamlike effect on the viewer,e116e24a-bd76-593f-9819-bbdb429bbafe_cap0_3,Michaela Skovranovas,e116e24a-bd76-593f-9819-bbdb429bbafe_cap2_2
