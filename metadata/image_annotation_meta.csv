The clothing and poses of the people in the photograph confirm to me that they are a part of a hip-hop dance group. The blacks and brighter colors of their outfits stand out against the serene whites and blues of the building and the reflections in the glass. The building looks a lot to me like a modern airport, or even a train station. ","This image makes me think that this dance group is working hard to become popular and gain notariety for their dancing. They have worked hard to build their abilities as dancers and have come together, taken on different yet coheisive character roles to be interesting as a group. The dancer in front has a serious and tough look on her face. She is the leader. The two men on either side of her, are in support of the leading role and remind me of a knight and a jester, or the right, and left hand men of the queen. The two women behind her are dressed more scantily and their poses are provacative. They remind me of ladies of the court. The man in the red hat has his hands together, as if he was saying, ""please give us a chance to perform for you, you will love it, I promise."" The way the building or structures around them looks like it could be an airport or train platform, make me think that this group is willing to travel to my town for a gig. I believe this group could have been put together by a manager who works for a company that funds performing artists as the combination of people has a certain all too convenient structure to it and in no way seems like a group like this would just come to know each other arbitrarily as a group of friends who dance and just happened to become friends with each other over the years would. ","The focus is on the dance group, as it is front and center in the photo. The photographer is positioned slightly lower then the dancers and their confident body language gives off a sense of their being very sure of their abilities as dancers.The contrast of tthe tough and casual ""look at me"" style of hip hop dance and clothing, against the whites and blues of the surrounding area of the photo make me look at the dancers before anything else in the photo. The dancers body language and expression tell a story. So does the positions of each dancer, in relation to each other. None of the colors clash with each other in a displeasing way, despite being so contrasting and different. "

Though the viewpoint of this photograph is from the position of one who may be included in the artist's painting, I can't help but feel as if I am getting in the way of the eyes of the artist. He seems to be slightly annoyed by my prescence. I believe this because of his body language. See how he arches his neck and squints his eyes? He doesn't want to see me but is entirely focused on the landscape behind me. This realization of being in the way, is comical and not apparent at first glance. To me this makes this photo surprisingly effective.","The impression of this being a photograph taken in pre-modern times is due to the color of the photograph being in Sepia tone, as well as the subject of the photo's clothing, and the old-fashioned bridge in the background.
